       <strong>Toronto</strong>, the capital of the province of Ontario, is a major Canadian city along Lake Ontario northwestern shore. It's a dynamic metropolis with a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic, free-standing CN Tower. Toronto also has many green spaces, from the orderly oval of Queens Park to 400-acre High Park and its trails, sports facilities and zoo.
